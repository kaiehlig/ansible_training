# Vagrant

[Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) is tool which makes it very easy
to create and manage VMs. With Vagrant you can describe one or multiple
VMs in a single text file. Vagrant works well together with different 
providers like [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads), 
[VMWare](http://www.vmware.com/), [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) and many 
more. By default it's using VirtualBox. So please make sure that you 
installed the current versions of: 

 - [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
 - [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)

If everything is successfully installed you should be able to run: 

```
vagrant --version
```

and get an output similar to: 

```
Vagrant 1.8.5
```
